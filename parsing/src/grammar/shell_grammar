The Shell Grammar Rules

1.  [Command Name]
    When the TOKEN is exactly a reserved word, the token identifier for that reserved word shall result.
    Otherwise, the token WORD shall be returned. Also, if the parser is in any state where only a reserved
    word could be the next correct token, proceed as above.

    Note:
        Because at this point quote marks are retained in the token, quoted strings cannot be recognized as
        reserved words. This rule also implies that reserved words are not recognized except in certain
        positions in the input, such as after a <newline> or semicolon; the grammar presumes that if the 
        reserved word is intened, it is properly delimited by the user, and does not attempt to reflect that
        requirement directly. Also note that line joining is done before tokenization, so escaped <newline>
        are already removed at this point.

2.  [Redirection to or from filename]
    The expansions specified in Redirection shall occur. As specified there, exactly one field can result (or
    the result is unspecified), and there are additional requirements on pathname expansion.

3. [Redirection from here-document]
    Quote removal shall be applied to the word to determine the delimiter that is used to find the end of the
    here-document that begins after the next <newline>.

4. [Case statement termination]
    When the TOKEN is exactly reserved word esac, the token identifier for esac shall result. Otherwise
    the token WORD shall be returned.

5. [NAME in for]
    When the TOKEN meets the requirements for a name, the token identifier NAME shall result. Otherwise, the
    token WORD shall be returned.

6. [Third word of for and esac]
    a. [case only]
        When the TOKEN is exactly the reserved word in, the token identifier for in shall result. Otherwise, the
        token WORD shall be returned.

    b. [for only]
        When the TOKEN is exactly the reserved word in or do, the token identifier for in or do shall result,
        respectively. Otherwise, the token WORD shall be returned.

    (For a. and b.: As indicated in the grammar, a linebreak precedes the token in or do. If <newline>s are present
        at the indicated location, it is the token after them that is treated in this fashion.)

7. [Assignment preceding command name]
    a. [When the first word]
        If the TOKEN does not contain the character '=', rule 1 is applied. Otherwirse, 7b shall be applied.

    b. [Not the first word]
        If the TOKEN contains the equal sign character:
            -> If it begins with '=', the token WORD shall be returned.
            -> If all the characters preceding '=' for a valid name, the token ASSIGNMENT_WORD shall be returned.
                (Quoted characters cannot participate in forming a valid name).
            -> Otherwise, it is unspecified whether it is ASSIGNMENT_WORD or WORD that is returned.

        Assignment to the NAME shall occur as specified in Simple Commands.

8. [NAME in function]
        When the TOKEN is exactly reserved word, the token identifier for that reserved word shall result. Otherwise,
        when the TOKEN meets the requirements for a name, the token identifier NAME shall result. Otherwise, rule 7 applies.
            
9. [Body of function]
    Word expansion and assignment shall never occur, even when required by the rules above, when this rule is being parsed.
    Each TOKEN that might either be expanded or have assignment applied to it shall instead be returned as a single WORD
    consisting only of characters that are exactly the token described in TOKEN RECOGNITION.
